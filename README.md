Data accompanying "Prion-like Domains Inhibit Aggregation Propensities through Wet Conformations and Abundant Internal Water" by Guorong Hu and co-workers.

The manuscript investigated wild-typeFUS PLD. Six independent simulations were performed for the protein, using Gromacs package. The Folder with the name of FUS PLD includes  initial conformation PDB files for all simulation trajectories.

The Folder "amber99SBdisp.ff" includes the force field files for simulations. And the Folder "MDP files" includes the molecular dynamics parameters files for simulations.

The Folder "Calculating internal water" includes the codes to calculate internal water molecules within the proteins
